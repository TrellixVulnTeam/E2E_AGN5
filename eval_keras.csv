/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1272-128104-0000.wav,187438,mister quilter is the apostle of the middle classes and we are glad to welcome his gospel
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1272-128104-0001.wav,154158,nor is mister quilter's manner less interesting than his matter
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1272-128104-0002.wav,399598,he tells us that at this festive season of the year with christmas and roast beef looming before us similes drawn from eating and its results occur most readily to the mind
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1272-128104-0003.wav,316878,he has grave doubts whether sir frederick leighton's work is really greek after all and can discover in it but little of rocky ithaca
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1272-128104-0004.wav,940878,linnell's pictures are a sort of up guards and at em paintings and mason's exquisite idylls are as national as a jingo poem mister birket foster's landscapes smile at one much in the same way that mister carker used to flash his teeth and mister john collier gives his sitter a cheerful slap on the back before he says like a shampooer in a turkish bath next man
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1272-128104-0005.wav,288398,it is obviously unnecessary for us to point out how luminous these criticisms are how delicate in expression
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1272-128104-0006.wav,180558,on the general principles of art mister quilter writes with equal lucidity
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1272-128104-0007.wav,295758,painting he tells us is of a different quality to mathematics and finish in art is adding more fact
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1272-128104-0008.wav,163918,as for etchings they are of two kinds british and foreign
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1272-128104-0009.wav,585358,he laments most bitterly the divorce that has been made between decorative art and what we usually call pictures makes the customary appeal to the last judgment and reminds us that in the great days of art michael angelo was the furnishing upholsterer
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1272-128104-0010.wav,179278,near the fire and the ornaments fred brought home from india on the mantel board
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1272-128104-0011.wav,483758,in fact he is quite severe on mister ruskin for not recognising that a picture should denote the frailty of man and remarks with pleasing courtesy and felicitous grace that many phases of feeling
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1272-128104-0012.wav,172238,only unfortunately his own work never does get good
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1272-128104-0013.wav,227278,mister quilter has missed his chance for he has failed even to make himself the tupper of painting

/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1272-135031-0000.wav,348398,because you were sleeping instead of conquering the lovely rose princess has become a fiddle without a bow while poor shaggy sits there a cooing dove
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1272-135031-0001.wav,356238,he has gone and gone for good answered polychrome who had managed to squeeze into the room beside the dragon and had witnessed the occurrences with much interest
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1272-135031-0002.wav,367278,i have remained a prisoner only because i wished to be one and with this he stepped forward and burst the stout chains as easily as if they had been threads
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1272-135031-0003.wav,152238,the little girl had been asleep but she heard the raps and opened the door
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1272-135031-0004.wav,135278,the king has fled in disgrace and your friends are asking for you
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1272-135031-0005.wav,148078,i begged ruggedo long ago to send him away but he would not do so
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1272-135031-0006.wav,130958,i also offered to help your brother to escape but he would not go
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1272-135031-0007.wav,129838,he eats and sleeps very steadily replied the new king
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1272-135031-0008.wav,117518,i hope he doesn't work too hard said shaggy
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1272-135031-0009.wav,61198,he doesn't work at all
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1272-135031-0010.wav,287918,in fact there is nothing he can do in these dominions as well as our nomes whose numbers are so great that it worries us to keep them all busy
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1272-135031-0011.wav,101838,not exactly returned kaliko
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1272-135031-0012.wav,65358,where is my brother now
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1272-135031-0013.wav,118478,inquired shaggy in the metal forest
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1272-135031-0014.wav,55758,where is that
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1272-135031-0015.wav,236078,the metal forest is in the great domed cavern the largest in all our dominions replied kaliko
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1272-135031-0016.wav,73038,kaliko hesitated
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1272-135031-0017.wav,219598,however if we look sharp we may be able to discover one of these secret ways
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1272-135031-0018.wav,78316,oh no i'm quite sure he didn't
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1272-135031-0019.wav,112878,that's funny remarked betsy thoughtfully
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1272-135031-0020.wav,148878,i don't believe ann knew any magic or she'd have worked it before
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1272-135031-0021.wav,83118,i do not know confessed shaggy
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1272-135031-0022.wav,86318,true agreed kaliko
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1272-135031-0023.wav,240718,kaliko went to the big gong and pounded on it just as ruggedo used to do but no one answered the summons
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1272-135031-0024.wav,463118,having returned to the royal cavern kaliko first pounded the gong and then sat in the throne wearing ruggedo's discarded ruby crown and holding in his hand the sceptre which ruggedo had so often thrown at his head
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1272-141231-0000.wav,148878,a man said to the universe sir i exist
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1272-141231-0001.wav,209198,sweat covered brion's body trickling into the tight loincloth that was the only garment he wore
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1272-141231-0002.wav,426798,the cut on his chest still dripping blood the ache of his overstrained eyes even the soaring arena around him with the thousands of spectators were trivialities not worth thinking about
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1272-141231-0003.wav,173518,his instant of panic was followed by a small sharp blow high on his chest
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1272-141231-0004.wav,162958,one minute a voice said and the time buzzer sounded
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1272-141231-0005.wav,185998,a minute is not a very large measure of time and his body needed every fraction of it
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1272-141231-0006.wav,157838,the buzzer's whirr triggered his muscles into complete relaxation
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1272-141231-0007.wav,151598,only his heart and lungs worked on at a strong measured rate
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1272-141231-0008.wav,147118,he was in reverie sliding along the borders of consciousness
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1272-141231-0009.wav,275918,the contestants in the twenties needed undisturbed rest therefore nights in the dormitories were as quiet as death
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1272-141231-0010.wav,344398,particularly so on this last night when only two of the little cubicles were occupied the thousands of others standing with dark empty doors
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1272-141231-0011.wav,160558,the other voice snapped with a harsh urgency clearly used to command
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1272-141231-0012.wav,247758,i'm here because the matter is of utmost importance and brandd is the one i must see now stand aside
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1272-141231-0013.wav,52556,the twenties
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1272-141231-0014.wav,233838,he must have drawn his gun because the intruder said quickly put that away you're being a fool out
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1272-141231-0015.wav,181838,there was silence then and still wondering brion was once more asleep
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1272-141231-0016.wav,59278,ten seconds
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1272-141231-0017.wav,119598,he asked the handler who was kneading his aching muscles
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1272-141231-0018.wav,192078,a red haired mountain of a man with an apparently inexhaustible store of energy
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1272-141231-0019.wav,150478,there could be little art in this last and final round of fencing
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1272-141231-0020.wav,138318,just thrust and parry and victory to the stronger
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1272-141231-0021.wav,148878,every man who entered the twenties had his own training tricks
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1272-141231-0022.wav,267278,there appeared to be an immediate association with the death trauma as if the two were inextricably linked into one
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1272-141231-0023.wav,277198,the strength that enables someone in a trance to hold his body stiff and unsupported except at two points the head and heels
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1272-141231-0024.wav,116558,this is physically impossible when conscious
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1272-141231-0025.wav,279278,others had died before during the twenties and death during the last round was in some ways easier than defeat
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1272-141231-0026.wav,212398,breathing deeply brion softly spoke the auto hypnotic phrases that triggered the process
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1272-141231-0027.wav,210318,when the buzzer sounded he pulled his foil from his second's startled grasp and ran forward
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1272-141231-0028.wav,180878,irolg looked amazed at the sudden fury of the attack then smiled
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1272-141231-0029.wav,220238,he thought it was a last burst of energy he knew how close they both were to exhaustion
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1272-141231-0030.wav,228238,brion saw something close to panic on his opponent's face when the man finally recognized his error
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1272-141231-0031.wav,227758,a wave of despair rolled out from irolg brion sensed it and knew the fifth point was his
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1272-141231-0032.wav,143438,then the powerful twist that thrust it aside in and under the guard
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1462-170138-0000.wav,465678,he had written a number of books himself among them a history of dancing a history of costume a key to shakespeare's sonnets a study of the poetry of ernest dowson et cetera
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1462-170138-0001.wav,127598,hugh's written a delightful part for her and she's quite inexpressible
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1462-170138-0002.wav,148718,i happen to have mac connell's box for tonight or there'd be no chance of our getting places
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1462-170138-0003.wav,74318,alexander exclaimed mildly
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1462-170138-0004.wav,80398,myself i always knew she had it in her
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1462-170138-0005.wav,421358,do you know alexander mainhall looked with perplexity up into the top of the hansom and rubbed his pink cheek with his gloved finger do you know i sometimes think of taking to criticism seriously myself
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1462-170138-0006.wav,274638,when they entered the stage box on the left the first act was well under way the scene being the interior of a cabin in the south of ireland
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1462-170138-0007.wav,168238,as they sat down a burst of applause drew alexander's attention to the stage
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1462-170138-0008.wav,202318,of course hilda is irish the burgoynes have been stage people for generations and she has the irish voice
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1462-170138-0009.wav,80238,it's delightful to hear it in a london theatre
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1462-170138-0010.wav,275758,when she began to dance by way of showing the gossoons what she had seen in the fairy rings at night the house broke into a prolonged uproar
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1462-170138-0011.wav,365518,after her dance she withdrew from the dialogue and retreated to the ditch wall back of philly's burrow where she sat singing the rising of the moon and making a wreath of primroses for her donkey
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1462-170138-0012.wav,123598,mac connell let me introduce mister bartley alexander
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1462-170138-0013.wav,224718,the playwright gave mainhall a curious look out of his deep set faded eyes and made a wry face
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1462-170138-0014.wav,157518,he nodded curtly and made for the door dodging acquaintances as he went
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1462-170138-0015.wav,108238,i dare say it's quite true that there's never been any one else
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1462-170138-0016.wav,109838,he's another who's awfully keen about her let me introduce you
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1462-170138-0017.wav,198798,sir harry towne bowed and said that he had met mister alexander and his wife in tokyo
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1462-170138-0018.wav,141036,i say sir harry the little girl's going famously to night isn't she
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1462-170138-0019.wav,113838,the fact is she's feeling rather seedy poor child
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1462-170138-0020.wav,75278,a little attack of nerves possibly
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1462-170138-0021.wav,308718,he bowed as the warning bell rang and mainhall whispered you know lord westmere of course the stooped man with the long gray mustache talking to lady dowle
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1462-170138-0022.wav,197998,in a moment peggy was on the stage again and alexander applauded vigorously with the rest
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1462-170138-0023.wav,304078,in the half light he looked about at the stalls and boxes and smiled a little consciously recalling with amusement sir harry's judicial frown
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1462-170138-0024.wav,523278,he leaned forward and beamed felicitations as warmly as mainhall himself when at the end of the play she came again and again before the curtain panting a little and flushed her eyes dancing and her eager nervous little mouth tremulous with excitement
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1462-170138-0025.wav,142158,all the same he lifted his glass here's to you little hilda
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1462-170138-0026.wav,76398,i'm glad she's held her own since
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1462-170138-0027.wav,160238,it was youth and poverty and proximity and everything was young and kindly
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1462-170142-0000.wav,150958,the last two days of the voyage bartley found almost intolerable
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1462-170142-0001.wav,306798,emerging at euston at half past three o'clock in the afternoon alexander had his luggage sent to the savoy and drove at once to bedford square
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1462-170142-0002.wav,206478,she blushed and smiled and fumbled his card in her confusion before she ran upstairs
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1462-170142-0003.wav,75918,the room was empty when he entered
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1462-170142-0004.wav,232238,a coal fire was crackling in the grate and the lamps were lit for it was already beginning to grow dark outside
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1462-170142-0005.wav,354638,she called his name on the threshold but in her swift flight across the room she felt a change in him and caught herself up so deftly that he could not tell just when she did it
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1462-170142-0006.wav,198318,she merely brushed his cheek with her lips and put a hand lightly and joyously on either shoulder
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1462-170142-0007.wav,78158,i never dreamed it would be you bartley
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1462-170142-0008.wav,153998,when did you come bartley and how did it happen you haven't spoken a word
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1462-170142-0009.wav,202798,she looked at his heavy shoulders and big determined head thrust forward like a catapult in leash
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1462-170142-0010.wav,146638,i'll do anything you wish me to bartley she said tremulously
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1462-170142-0011.wav,104398,he pulled up a window as if the air were heavy
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1462-170142-0012.wav,213518,hilda watched him from her corner trembling and scarcely breathing dark shadows growing about her eyes
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1462-170142-0013.wav,124878,it it hasn't always made you miserable has it
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1462-170142-0014.wav,81678,always but it's worse now
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1462-170142-0015.wav,96398,it's unbearable it tortures me every minute
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1462-170142-0016.wav,199758,i am not a man who can live two lives he went on feverishly each life spoils the other
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1462-170142-0017.wav,74158,i get nothing but misery out of either
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1462-170142-0018.wav,104558,there is this deception between me and everything
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1462-170142-0019.wav,327918,at that word deception spoken with such self contempt the color flashed back into hilda's face as suddenly as if she had been struck by a whiplash
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1462-170142-0020.wav,158318,she bit her lip and looked down at her hands which were clasped tightly in front of her
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1462-170142-0021.wav,261518,could you could you sit down and talk about it quietly bartley as if i were a friend and not some one who had to be defied
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1462-170142-0022.wav,120398,he dropped back heavily into his chair by the fire
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1462-170142-0023.wav,89998,i have thought about it until i am worn out
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1462-170142-0024.wav,69038,after the very first
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1462-170142-0025.wav,177678,hilda's face quivered but she whispered yes i think it must have been
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1462-170142-0026.wav,154798,she pressed his hand gently in gratitude weren't you happy then at all
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1462-170142-0027.wav,134158,something of their troubling sweetness came back to alexander too
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1462-170142-0028.wav,96238,presently it stole back to his coat sleeve
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1462-170142-0029.wav,127278,yes hilda i know that he said simply
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1462-170142-0030.wav,86638,i understand bartley i was wrong
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1462-170142-0031.wav,154478,she listened intently but she heard nothing but the creaking of his chair
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1462-170142-0032.wav,88718,you want me to say it she whispered
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1462-170142-0033.wav,133838,bartley leaned his head in his hands and spoke through his teeth
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1462-170142-0034.wav,80718,it's got to be a clean break hilda
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/1462-170142-0035.wav,85518,oh bartley what am i to do
